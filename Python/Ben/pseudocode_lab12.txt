pseudocode
1. declare variables
index = 0
lowestprice = int(0)
sellingprice = []
sellingprice = [125900,115000,105900,85000,150000,155249,97500]
avg = float()
homeowner = ['Carson','Smith','Jackson','Swanson','Perry','Beufort','Anderson']
aboveavg = int(0)
belowavg = int(0)
highestprice = int(0)

2. Header

print('Welcome to the Botany Bay home sales calculator.\n This program will calculate the average selling price of the homes sold\n this past year. It will then determine how many homes sold\n above average, below average, the price average, the highest priced,\n and the lowest prices homes.\n===================================\nBotany Bay Home Sales\n*********************')
3. output all house information

while index < 7:
    print(index, '.\t',homeowner[index],'%04s' % '','\t$',sellingprice[index])
    index +=1
4. determine the average
avg = (125900+115000+105900+85000+150000+155249+97500)/7
print("\nThe average selling price is: $",avg)

5. determine quantity of houses above average
index = 0
while index < 7:
    if sellingprice[index] > avg:
        aboveavg +=1
    index +=1
print('\nNumber of houses above average price:',aboveavg)

6. determine quantity of houses below average
index = 0
while index < 7:
    if sellingprice[index] < avg:
        belowavg += 1
    index += 1
print('Number of houses above below price:',belowavg)

7. find highest priced house
index = 0
highestprice = sellingprice[index]
while index < 7:
    if sellingprice[index]>highestprice:
        highestprice = sellingprice[index]
    index +=1
print("\nThe highest priced house is: $",highestprice)

8. find lowest priced house
index = 0
lowestprice = sellingprice[index]
while index < 7:
    if sellingprice[index]<lowestprice:
        lowestprice = sellingprice[index]
    index +=1
print("\nThe lowest priced house is: $",lowestprice)
