Problem Statement: Make a program that will output the user's item, the original price, and the discount for each day.
Inputs: Item, original price
Outputs: Item, Original price, discounted price, day
Variable Name		Datatype
items = int(0)
days = int(0)
discount = float()
price = float()
discountprice = float()


1.Declare Variables
items = int(0)
days = int(0)
discount = float()
price = float()
discountprice = float()

2. Set the loop
while items <= 4:
3. Get inputs

    item = input("What is your item?")
    price = float(input("How much does your item cost?"))
4. Display/print the header / dividers
    print("-----------------------\n","Item Name:   ",item,"\nOriginal Cost:    ",price,"\nDay  Discount    Discount Price\n","-----------------------\n")
5. Set the nested while loop so it calculates this every time one item/index is added
    while days <= 5:
6. Calculate prices
        discountprice = price * .9
        price = discountprice
7. Display results
        print("",days,"  $ ",discount, "    $ ",discountprice)
8. Add one day so the loop continues until the fifth day is reached.
        days = days + 1
items + 1
